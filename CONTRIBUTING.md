## üêõ Found a Bug?

- **Do not open a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability.**  
  Instead, report it confidentially via email: [info@bitbybit.dev](mailto:info@bitbybit.dev)

- **Check for existing issues** before reporting a new one by searching in the [Issues section](https://github.com/bitbybit-dev/bitbybit/issues)

- If no existing issue addresses the problem, [open a new issue](https://github.com/bitbybit-dev/bitbybit/issues/new).  
  Please include:
  - A clear and descriptive title
  - A detailed explanation of the issue
  - A code snippet or an executable test case that demonstrates the issue  
    One of the best ways is to reproduce the bug in our [TypeScript online editor](https://bitbybit.dev/app?editor=typescript) and paste that code into the issue.  
    Keep the example as concise and focused as possible.
