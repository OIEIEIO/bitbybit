This time, we mostly focused on improving the quality of our `@bitbybit-dev/occt` layer. Offsets were extended to support adding a face for guidance.

### Offset with Face Guidance

We've enhanced our offsetting capabilities to provide more control and better results in complex geometrical situations:

*   **`bitbybit.occt.operations.offset`**:
    *   The inputs for this operation now accept an additional `face` parameter for guidance. Sometimes, providing a guiding face is necessary to help the algorithm determine the correct offset solution, especially in ambiguous or tricky geometric scenarios.
*   **`bitbybit.occt.operations.offsetAdv`**:
    *   This advanced offset algorithm also now supports a `face` for guidance. It serves as an alternative method with more customization options exposed through its inputs.

### Unit Tests And Refactoring

We have been dedicated to improving the quality and reliability of our core codebase. A significant part of this effort involved adding new unit tests and restructuring the code within the `@bitbybit-dev/occt` layer.
