In this release (v0.15.10), we mostly concentrated on improving the BITBYBIT-RUNNER.JS and adding exciting new support for Gaussian Splatting, enabling you to work with cutting-edge 3D scan data.

### List of Updates

Here are the key updates in this version:

*   **`bitbybit.babylon.gaussianSplatting.create`**
    *   This new function allows you to load a Gaussian Splat (`.splat` or `.ply` containing splat data) from any URL and returns a BabylonJS mesh for rendering in your scene. This opens up possibilities for integrating high-fidelity 3D scans directly into your Bitbybit.dev projects.
*   **`bitbybit.occt.shapes.wire.createZigZagBetweenTwoWires`**
    *   We've enhanced this wire creation tool. Wires can now be subdivided along all their edges by a specified number.
    *   Additionally, it can now use a "divide by equal distance" approach for subdivision, instead of relying solely on curve parameters, offering more predictable results in certain scenarios.
*   **`bitbybit.occt.shapeToMesh`**
    *   This function has been normalized to accept an input DTO (Data Transfer Object), aligning it with our more recent API patterns for consistency and ease of use.
*   **PLY and SPLAT File Type Support in Asset Management**
    *   We have officially added support for `.ply` (Polygon File Format, often used for 3D scans and Gaussian Splats) and `.splat` file types in our asset manager and cloud storage.
    *   You will now be able to upload, host, and manage these files directly on the Bitbybit.dev platform and seamlessly use them in your projects, particularly with the new Gaussian Splatting feature.
