In our ongoing mission to make powerful 3D design tools accessible to everyone, we're thrilled to announce a significant milestone: **all components of Bitbybit.dev's Rete and Blockly visual programming editors are now translated into multiple new languages!**

<!--truncate-->

Alongside English, we now proudly support:
*   **Spanish (Español)**
*   **Hindi (हिन्दी)**
*   **Arabic (العربية)**
*   **Chinese (中文)**
*   **French (Français)**
*   **Lithuanian (Lietuvių)**

You'll also find a new language selection button within the platform, allowing you to easily switch to your preferred language.

Imagine a world where the language you speak doesn’t limit your ability to create, design, and innovate. A world where children from Buenos Aires to Beijing can explore the wonders of 3D design in their own tongue. Bitbybit.dev is making this a reality. This exciting development is more than just a technical update — it’s a transformative step toward making technology and education truly accessible to millions worldwide.

To select your preferred language, look for the new language switcher button in our editors:

### Why Language Matters in STEM

Language is a powerful tool. It’s how we connect, learn, and express ourselves. But when educational resources are locked behind a language barrier, they become unreachable for many. In STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, where innovation drives progress, this issue is especially pressing.

Complex concepts like coding and 3D design can already feel daunting—add the challenge of navigating them in a foreign language, and they can seem insurmountable. By translating its visual programming tools into multiple languages, Bitbybit.dev is tearing down these walls, inviting a global audience to engage with STEM on their own terms.

### Empowering Kids with Intuitive Learning

For kids, learning to program can be like building with digital bricks. Visual programming editors like Rete and Blockly make this process intuitive by replacing complex lines of code with simple drag-and-drop blocks. This approach lets young learners focus on logic and creativity rather than wrestling with syntax.

Now, with these tools available in languages like Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, Chinese, French, and Lithuanian, the learning experience becomes even more seamless and engaging. A child in Cairo can experiment with 3D geometry in Arabic, while a peer in Paris does the same in French. This not only boosts confidence but also sparks curiosity, making STEM approachable and exciting for kids who might otherwise feel excluded.

Take, for example, a young student in rural India. Hindi is her first language, and English feels distant and unfamiliar. Before this translation effort, exploring 3D CAD might have been a struggle, an additional layer of difficulty on top of learning new concepts. Now, with Bitbybit.dev’s Hindi interface, she can dive into the world of 3D design, creating shapes and structures in a language she knows best. This isn’t just about convenience—it’s about empowerment, giving kids everywhere the chance to see themselves as future innovators, regardless of their linguistic background.

### Unlocking Parametric Design for All

Parametric design—a method of defining objects using variables, parameters, and relationships—is a cornerstone of modern 3D CAD. It’s a powerful skill used extensively in engineering, architecture, and product design, but it’s also inherently abstract and can be challenging to learn.

Visual programming simplifies this by letting users manipulate parameters and see results through a graphical interface. When that interface speaks your language, the learning curve flattens even more dramatically. By making parametric design accessible in native languages, Bitbybit.dev is equipping users worldwide with the tools to tackle advanced concepts without the added cognitive load of translation.

In a world that’s increasingly connected yet wonderfully diverse, access to technology shouldn’t hinge on the language you speak. Bitbybit.dev is dedicated to creating accessible design tools for everyone. We believe that the future of STEM is multilingual, and with these new translations, it’s brighter than ever.

We plan to add support for even more languages to Bitbybit.dev in the near future. Community feedback plays a crucial role in shaping these translations and helping us prioritize. You can also contribute your suggestions or improvements directly via pull requests to our GitHub repository:
