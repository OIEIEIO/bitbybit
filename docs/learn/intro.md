# Welcome! ðŸŽ‰

We're thrilled you're interested in using our platform! These "Start" pages are designed to help you quickly get up to speed and begin creating amazing 3D experiences.

Let's find the best starting point for you:

### Are you looking for ready-made 3D models?

Many of our standalone 3D model configurators require a subscription to our paid plans: Silver or Gold.

*   **Gold Plan:** Provides access to **all** our configurators and cloud services.
*   **Silver Plan:** Offers access to simpler, everyday parametric 3D model configurators.

Visit the [**3D Models**](https://bitbybit.dev/3d-models) section of our platform, browse through the categories to find what you need, and then decide which plan best suits your requirements.

<Admonition type="info" title="Suggesting New Models">
  <p>Our list of configurators is constantly growing! If the model you're looking for isn't available yet, feel free to submit a request to our team. We carefully consider each request, and if it aligns with our mission, we'll aim to create a configurator for it.</p>
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Suggesting ideas for configurators does not make you the author, grant you any rights to the resulting applications, or entitle you to compensation. We also do not guarantee that suggested configurators will work exactly as you envision. However, you'll benefit from the ability to use the new configurator, which we hope is a great incentive!</p>
  <p>For more details, please review our <a href="/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

### Are you a beginner computational designer?

Welcome aboard! We recommend the following path:

1.  Start with our [**Getting Started**](/learn/getting-started/overview) guide. This will cover the basics.
2.  Once you've completed that, try building something cool using our editors!
3.  For more in-depth learning, explore the courses in our [**School**](https://bitbybit.dev/school).
4.  Curious about why this platform exists? Read our [**About**](./about) section.
5.  Analyze public scripts from other users on our [**Public Projects**](https://bitbybit.dev/projects/public) page. Reviewing others' work is a fantastic way to learn. Start with shorter scripts and gradually move to more complex ones.

### Are you an expert computational designer?

If you're experienced with computational design tools like Grasshopper, Dynamo, or Blender Nodes, you might want to:

*   Dive into creating your own designs using our core algorithms.
*   Give our **Rete editor** a try for visual node-based programming.
*   Explore our **Blockly editor** for building more advanced 3D models and real-time simulations with visual programming.
*   If you're comfortable with code (or eager to learn), check out the "Programmer" section below.

### Are you a teacher or an educator?

This platform is a great place to teach 3D computational design, mathematics, geometry, and programming.

*   We recommend signing up to utilize our cloud services for the full experience.
*   However, **children can use the editors without any sign-ups or registrations, completely free of charge.** Note that some advanced algorithms and 3D models may not be available in this mode.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Important for Young Learners (No Account Needed)">
  <p>We prioritize child privacy. Children do not need accounts to use the editors.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They <strong>must remember to manually export and import their scripts</strong> to avoid losing their work, as cloud saving is not available without an account.</li>
    <li>Sharing projects is not possible without an account.</li>
    <li>They will need to host any third-party assets locally in their browsers, as cloud asset features are unavailable. Learn how in the <a href="/learn/getting-started/basics/assets/local/intro">Local Assets</a> section of the Getting Started guide.</li>
  </ul>

If you're familiar with our tools and interested in becoming a teacher in our School to share your knowledge, please reach out to us at [info@bitbybit.dev](mailto:info@bitbybit.dev).

### Are you a programmer?

If you're a professional programmer, you can jump right into our **TypeScript Monaco editor**.

To get started:

*   Consider our course: [**Introduction To Programming 3D In TypeScript**](https://bitbybit.dev/school/courses/introduction-to-programming-3d-in-typescript).
*   Or, if you're familiar with BabylonJS: [**Bitbybit For BabylonJS Developers**](https://bitbybit.dev/school/courses/bitbybit-for-babylonjs-developers).
    These courses explore how our algorithms can create 3D CAD applications.
*   We also offer [**NPM packages**](/learn/npm-packages/intro) that you can incorporate into your own websites.
    *   *Note: These packages do not include our proprietary advanced algorithms or the models available in the 3D Models section.*
