# 3D Bits: Interactive 3D Product Visualization for Your Shopify Store

## What is 3D Bits?

**3D Bits** is a Shopify app that lets you add interactive 3D product configurators and visualizations to your online store. With 3D Bits, your customers can see and customize products in real-time 3D, making shopping more engaging and helping them understand exactly what they’re buying.

**Try it out:**
*   Visit our **[Demo Store](https://bitbybit-dev-3d-configurators.myshopify.com)**
*   Use password: `3d-bits-demo`

## Why Use 3D Bits?

Traditional online stores use static images, but modern shoppers want to see products from every angle and try out different options. 3D Bits makes this possible by letting you build interactive 3D experiences for your products—no advanced coding required.

## How Does 3D Bits Work?

3D Bits is built on the [bitbybit.dev](https://bitbybit.dev) platform, which provides powerful 3D and CAD tools for both beginners and professionals. You can:

- Use **No-Code** configurators to quickly set up 3D product pages.
- Try **Low-Code** visual programming for more control.
- Write custom logic with **TypeScript** if you want advanced features.
- For developers, connect with popular 3D engines and use professional tools like VSCode.

## Plans

Currently, we offer 2 subscription plans: `Basic` and `Pro`.

### Basic Plan

The Basic plan is designed for most merchants and offers a lot of No-Code and Low-Code solutions for building 3D experiences on your Shopify storefront. You can easily configure static and dynamic 3D scenes, and use visual or TypeScript code snippets for extra logic. This plan is ideal if you want to present configurable products in 3D and only need to handle some, but not huge amounts, of logic and complexity. Most technically-minded merchants will find the Basic plan covers common use-cases for 3D product pages.

- Use No-Code and Low-Code tools to create interactive 3D scenes.
- Add short scripts for custom behaviors.
- Built to simplify 3D product presentation, but flexible enough for moderate customization.
- Supports the BabylonJS game engine.

### Pro Plan

The Pro plan is for merchants with professional development teams or those who hire programmers. Some 3D experiences can become very complex, and even our Low-Code editors or built-in TypeScript environment may not be enough. If you want to set up projects inside game engines such as ThreeJS, BabylonJS, or PlayCanvas, or if your team wants to host code on their own GitHub repositories, use VSCode, or write unit tests, the Pro plan is for you. We provide access to pre-built Vite TypeScript templates and support for advanced workflows.

- Build complex 3D experiences with your choice of engine or framework.
- Use your own codebase, GitHub, and professional tools.
- Ideal for custom solutions, advanced logic, or large-scale projects.
- Access to Vite TypeScript templates and more.

**How to choose?**

It depends on your needs and preferences. As a guideline: if your configurators start reaching 5000 lines of code, managing them with simple inline scripts becomes difficult—consider moving to the Pro plan. Also, if you want to use a custom game engine or install different NPM packages, you'll need Pro. The Basic plan is built on BabylonJS; for other technologies, go Pro.
