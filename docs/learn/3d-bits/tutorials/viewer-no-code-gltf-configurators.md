# No-Code GLTF Configurators with BITBYBIT VIEWER Editor on Shopify

## What's Inside This Tutorial?

We're excited to introduce a powerful, **no-code** solution for creating interactive 3D product configurators on your Shopify store! This tutorial focuses on our new **Viewer Editor tool**, which allows you to easily set up scenes with multiple GLTF assets and link their visibility or properties to your native Shopify product variants.

You will learn how to:
*   Use the **BITBYBIT VIEWER** theme app extension block.
*   Leverage the **Viewer Editor** (part of the "3D Bits" app) to assemble and configure a 3D scene using your existing GLTF assets.
*   Create a dynamic **3D chair configurator** that responds to Shopify variant selections (e.g., changing colors, parts), all **without writing a single line of code.**

We've observed that many merchants want to use their ready-made GLTF assets to build 3D configurators. Previously, making these assets respond to Shopify variants typically required scripting in our Bitbybit programming editors. Now, with the Viewer Editor, this process has become significantly simpler and entirely code-free.
