# Tutorial: Using a 3D Bike Scan as a Shopify Product

## What's Inside This Tutorial?

In this tutorial, you will learn the complete workflow for incorporating a 3D scan of a bike into your Shopify store as an interactive product. This example focuses on a straightforward yet highly effective use case for 3D in e-commerce.

We will cover:
*   **3D Scanning the Bike:** Tips and considerations for capturing the bike.
*   **Editing and Processing the Scan:** Basic steps to refine the raw 3D scan data.
*   **Uploading to Shopify CDN:** How to get your processed 3D model onto Shopify's Content Delivery Network.
*   **Exposing as a Product with "3D Bits":** Using our "3D Bits" app (likely the [BITBYBIT VIEWER block](/learn/3d-bits/theme-app-extensions/bitbybit-viewer)) to display the 3D scan on your product page.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to showcase a detailed, interactive 3D model of a bike (or similar product) in your Shopify store.

**View the Demo:**
*   Check out the live example on our [Demo Store: Bike 3D Scan Product Page](https://bitbybit-dev-3d-configurators.myshopify.com/products/3d-bike-scan).
