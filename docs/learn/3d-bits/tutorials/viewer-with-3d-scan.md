# Using BITBYBIT VIEWER With a 3D Scanned Product (Gaussian Splat)

## What's Inside This Tutorial?

The **BITBYBIT VIEWER** block is one of the latest powerful additions to our "3D Bits" app for Shopify. This tutorial, led by Matas Ubareviƒçius, will guide you through the entire process of creating product pages featuring 3D scanned models, specifically focusing on **Gaussian Splatting (`.splat`) files**.

A key advantage of the BITBYBIT VIEWER block is that it **does not require users to interact with the Bitbybit editors**. You can load your 3D asset files directly from Shopify's CDN or any other public URL. For this tutorial, the `.splat` model of a chair was created using the Scaniverse app.

You will learn how to:
*   Prepare and upload your 3D scan (e.g., a `.splat` file) to Shopify's CDN.
*   Update the necessary product metafields provided by the "3D Bits" app.
*   Create a new product template in your Shopify theme.
*   Add the BITBYBIT VIEWER theme app extension block to this template.
*   Dynamically link the VIEWER block's settings (like Model URL, camera position, background color) to your product metafields.
*   Configure basic settings for the 3D viewing experience, such as the default camera position, target, and background color, to best showcase your scanned product.
