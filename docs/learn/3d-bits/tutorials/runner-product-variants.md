# Creating 3D Product Variants with "3D Bits" on Shopify

## How to Create Interactive 3D Product Variants

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a very basic **3D configurable product**—a simple cube—and making its properties (like size or color) change based on **Shopify product variant inputs**. This is achieved using the "3D Bits" app, in conjunction with the [BITBYBIT RUNNER](/learn/3d-bits/theme-app-extensions/bitbybit-runner).

We strongly encourage you to watch the video tutorial and follow along, repeating the steps one by one. This hands-on approach will help you grasp the fundamental concepts needed to create more complex and sophisticated 3D configurable products for your Shopify store in the future.

**Note for this tutorial:** To encourage active learning and experimentation, we will not be providing the final, complete code snippets in this written guide. The focus is on understanding the process demonstrated in the video.
