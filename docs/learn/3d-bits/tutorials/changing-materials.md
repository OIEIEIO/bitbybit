# Change Materials, Colours, Textures of 3D Shopify Products

## Blender to 3D Bits Workflow Explained

In this step-by-step tutorial, you’ll discover how to create, assign, and save material variants in Blender, then export them with the help of the [KHR_materials_variants](https://www.khronos.org/blog/streamlining-3d-commerce-with-material-variant-support-in-gltf-assets) extension into a GLTF file using the official [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) add-on from the [Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org/3dcommerce/). From there, we’ll guide you through the process of importing these material variants directly into the 3D Bits app for Shopify and mapping them to your product page inputs for a seamless shopping experience.
