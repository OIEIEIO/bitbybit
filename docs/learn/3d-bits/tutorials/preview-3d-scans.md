# Using BITBYBIT PREVIEW With a 3D Scanned Product

## What's Inside This Tutorial?

The **BITBYBIT PREVIEW** theme app extension block, part of our "3D Bits" Shopify app, allows you to embed **publicly available Bitbybit projects** directly onto your Shopify product pages. While these embedded 3D experiences generally cannot be configured by Shopify product variants in the same dynamic way as with the [RUNNER](/shopify/3d-bits-app/bitbybit-runner) or [VIEWER](/shopify/3d-bits-app/bitbybit-viewer) (with Scene Config JSON) blocks, they are excellent for showcasing rich, unique, and interactive 3D product presentations, including those featuring **3D scanned products**.

This tutorial, led by Matas Ubareviƒçius, will guide you through:
*   Setting up a Shopify product template to use the BITBYBIT PREVIEW block.
*   Understanding and configuring the necessary product metafields, specifically the "3D Bits Model Url."
*   Locating the correct "preview URL" for your scripts on the Bitbybit platform.
*   Linking this preview URL to your Shopify product to display your 3D scanned model or interactive scene.

**Prerequisites:**
*   It's assumed you have already installed the "3D Bits" app in your Shopify store.
*   You have a Bitbybit project (containing your 3D scanned model or a scene using it) that is **published as "Public."**
