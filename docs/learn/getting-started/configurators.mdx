# 3D Model Configurators

Our 3D Model Configurators empower you to take existing parametric 3D models and easily tailor them to your specific requirements by adjusting key variables through simple inputs.

## Parametric 3D Models: Customization Made Easy

Imagine finding a 3D model online that's *almost* perfect, but needs a few dimensional tweaks. Instead of wrestling with complex software or paying for custom modifications, our platform allows you to make these adjustments directly. The underlying procedural 3D model adapts instantly to your preferences.

Once you're satisfied with your customizations, you can export the final design in several popular industry-standard file formats:
*   STEP
*   IGES
*   STL
*   GLTF

### How Does It Work?

<Admonition type="info" title="Subscription Required for Most Configurators">
  <p>To access the majority of our 3D Model Configurators, you'll need to sign up and subscribe to either our <strong>Silver</strong> or <strong>Gold</strong> plan.</p>
  <p>A few free configurators are available, but these are typically simpler models or fall into our "Kids" category.</p>
</Admonition>

With an active subscription, when you navigate to a 3D model's page, you'll see the interactive configurator interface instead of a static presentation page. This allows you to:

1.  Adjust the various exposed properties of the design.
2.  See the model update in real-time (or after changes are applied, depending on the configurator).
3.  Export the customized model once you're happy with it.

**Example: Arabic Archway Configurator (Gold Plan)**

The video below demonstrates one of our configurators. This particular one (Arabic Archway) is accessible with our Gold plan.

**Example: Embedded Configurator**

While the video shows one type, other configurators are free and can be directly interacted with. Here are few examples of such configurators:
