# Rete Editor

## What is Rete?

<a href="https://retejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rete.js</a> is a highly flexible framework for visual programming. Developed by Vitaliy Stoliarov, it empowers programmers to create their own node-based visual programming editors tailored for specific domains.

This is precisely what we've done at Bitbybit. We've taken the Rete.js framework and used it to expose our unique 3D algorithms and components through a visual, node-based interface. We proudly call our editor "Rete" to honor the original framework, as we believe it's an amazing open-source technology that everyone in the visual programming space should explore.

## Why Rete?

The node-based approach to scripting geometry, as facilitated by Rete.js, is familiar to many computational designers worldwide. Highly popular and powerful tools in various industries utilize a similar visual programming paradigm, including:

*   Grasshopper (for Rhino)
*   Dynamo (for Revit)
*   Houdini
*   Unreal Engine (Blueprints)
*   Blender (Geometry Nodes, Shader Editor)
*   Godot Engine (VisualScript)
*   And many others...

Recognizing this established and intuitive way of thinking about parametric design, we decided to adopt Rete.js. We believe this visual approach is a significant part of the future of programming complex systems, and we are excited to contribute to its adoption and evolution, particularly in the realm of web-based 3D geometry.
