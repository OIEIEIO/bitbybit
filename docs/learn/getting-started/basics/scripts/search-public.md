# Searching Public Scripts

## How to Find a Specific Public Script

On our [Public Projects Gallery](https://bitbybit.dev/projects/public) page, you'll find a button labeled **"Search Public Scripts"**. Clicking this button opens a dialog window with a single search input field. You can use this field to search for scripts by their:

*   Title
*   Author's name
*   Description
*   Even parts of the code within the script

## What Kinds of Scripts Are Searchable?

Currently, the search functionality is limited to scripts that meet the following criteria:
*   They must be part of a **Public Project**.

Scripts within Silver community projects, Gold community projects, or Private projects are **not** included in the search results.

## How Search Indexing Works

Please note that our search feature is currently somewhat experimental.
*   **Indexing is not real-time:** If you create a new public project or update a script within an existing public project, it might not be immediately searchable. There can be a delay before the search index updates.
*   **Deleted projects:** Similarly, if a public project is deleted, its scripts might remain searchable for a short period until the index refreshes.

We will improve this feature in the future.
