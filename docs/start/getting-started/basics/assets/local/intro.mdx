# Using Local Assets (Stored in Your Browser)

## When to Use Local Assets

If you prefer not to use our cloud services for storing your assets, or if you want to keep certain files entirely on your own machine for privacy or testing, Bitbybit offers a **local asset** feature. This allows you to upload assets directly to your web browser's local storage. Once uploaded, you can import and use these assets in your scripts.

**Key Characteristics and Considerations for Local Assets:**

*   **Browser-Specific:** Local assets are stored within the specific browser you used to upload them. They are **not** shared across different browsers (e.g., Chrome vs. Firefox) or different devices.
*   **Sharing Limitations:**
    *   If your script relies on local assets and you [export the script to a file](/start/getting-started/basics/scripts/save-to-file) to share with others, those users will **not** automatically have the asset. You would need to provide them with the asset file separately, and they would have to upload it as a local asset in their own browser.
*   **Persistence (Within the Same Browser):** Local assets generally persist within your browser even after you close and reopen the browser window. However, clearing your browser's cache or site data could potentially remove them.
*   **No Account Needed:** You can use the local asset feature without needing a Bitbybit account.

This tutorial will guide you through using local assets in your Bitbybit projects.

## Learn Through Examples

We'll demonstrate how to use local assets with a few practical examples. You'll download sample asset files, upload them to Bitbybit as local assets, and then use specific Input/Output (IO) components within our Rete, Blockly, and Monaco (TypeScript) editors to draw these assets as visible BabylonJS meshes.

Each example will focus on a different common file type so you can see the process in action.

3.  **Using a Local STEP File (CAD Standard):**
    *   Learn how to work with `.step` or `.stp` files, a widely used format in the CAD (Computer-Aided Design) industry.
